                    Apples are among the world’s most popular fruits.
                    They grow on the apple tree (Malus domestica), originally from Central Asia.
                    <br> Apples are high in fiber, vitamin C, and various antioxidants. They are also very filling,
                    considering their low calorie count. Studies show that eating apples can have multiple benefits for
                    your health.
                    Usually eaten raw, apples can also be used in various recipes, juices, and drinks. Various types
                    abound, with a variety of colors and sizes.

                    • The planting distance varies according to variety and the fertility level of the soil. The main
                    consideration in planting trees is planting of sufficient pollinators to ensure effective
                    pollination<br>
                    • Usually one pollinator tree is needed for two to three large trees planted at 10 m distance or one
                    row pollinator for two rows of main cultivar. For high density planting the pollinator tree is
                    planted after every sixth tree in a row. <br>•The most widely used planting system is the square
                    system. In this system, the pollinators are planted after every sixth or ninth tree. <br>
                    • The other popular system of planting is the rectangular system. In hilly areas the apple orchards
                    are established by planting the trees on the contours so as to prevent soil erosion and reduce run
                    off..<br>
                    • The average number of plants in an area of one ha. Can range between 200 to 1250. Four different
                    categories of planting density are followed viz.<br>
                    • Low (less than 250 plants/ha.), moderate (250-500 plants/ha.), high (500-1250 plants/ha.) and
                    ultra high density (more than 1250 plants /ha.). <br>
                    • The combination of rootstock and scion variety determines the plant spacing and planting
                    density/unit area<br>

                                    • Planting is usually done in the month of January and February. <br>
                                    • Pits measuring 60 cm are dug two weeks before planting.<br>
                                    • The pits are filled with good loamy soil and organic matter. .<br>
                                    • Planting is done in the centre of the pit by scooping the soil and placing the
                                    soil ball keeping the roots intact. <br>
                                    • Loose soil is filled up in the remaining area and lightly pressed to remove air
                                    gaps. The seedlings are staked and watered immediately.
