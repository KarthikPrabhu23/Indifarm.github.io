Surface Irrigation is a kind of irrigation where gravity works its best. In Surface Irrigation, water is applied and distributed over the soil surface by the help of gravity. Throughout the world, this is the most commonly used type of irrigation process. Surface Irrigation is an unchanged process and it is older than its recognition. For thousands of years, people are practicing this irrigation process. There is a misconception that, Surface Irrigation process is sometimes considered as Flood Irrigation because of uncontrolled water distribution. But if applied correctly, Surface Irrigation can be your best irrigation process to water your plants.<br>

                   <h2><font color="grey">How Does Surface Irrigation System Work?</font></h2><p><font>

The surface Irrigation system is very easy yet natural. You need to go through only four phases and your process is done. At first, water is supplied to the top end of the fields, it naturally follows to the field length. Now it is the Advance Phase. It depends on the length of time of the water supply. Again, water is supplied to the top end of the fields, it gradually runs off to the pond. Next is the Storage Phase. The period of time in this is between the end of the advance phase and the shut-off phase. Depletion phase is a short period of time when the length of the field is submerged. Last is the Recession phase. It is the time period while the waterfront goes toward the downstream end of the field.<br><br><br><br><br>
