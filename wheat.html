                    Apples are among the world’s most popular fruits.
                    They grow on the apple tree (Malus domestica), originally from Central Asia.
                    <br> Apples are high in fiber, vitamin C, and various antioxidants. They are also very filling,
                    considering their low calorie count. Studies show that eating apples can have multiple benefits for
                    your health.
                    Usually eaten raw, apples can also be used in various recipes, juices, and drinks. Various types
                    abound, with a variety of colors and sizes.

                    • The wheat seeds must be sown in about 4 to 5 cm inside the soil. Always put the seeds in rows and maintain a spacing of 20-22.5 cm between the rows<br>
                    • Planting or sowing the seeds in the right time is also important as delayed sowing can cause a gradual decline in the production. In India, it is generally sown in the end of October and early November. <br>•The most widely used planting system is the square
                    system. In this system, the pollinators are planted after every sixth or ninth tree. <br>
                    •Also see that the wheat seeds is properly graded and thoroughly cleaned before sowing. Here you can apply fungicide for treating the seeds<br>
                    • The average number of plants in an area of one ha. Can range between 200 to 1250. Four different
                    categories of planting density are followed viz.<br>
                    <!-- • Low (less than 250 plants/ha.), moderate (250-500 plants/ha.), high (500-1250 plants/ha.) and
                    ultra high density (more than 1250 plants /ha.). <br>
                    • The combination of rootstock and scion variety determines the plant spacing and planting

                                    • Planting is usually done in the month of January and February. <br>
                                    • Pits measuring 60 cm are dug two weeks before planting.<br>
                                    • The pits are filled with good loamy soil and organic matter. .<br>
                                    • Planting is done in the centre of the pit by scooping the soil and placing the
                                    soil ball keeping the roots intact. <br>
                                    • Loose soil is filled up in the remaining area and lightly pressed to remove air
                                    gaps. The seedlings are staked and watered immediately.
