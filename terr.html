STerrace farming is a type of agriculture that rearranges farmlands to convert for growing crops. The method of growing crops on mountains and hills is known as terrace farming. A part terrace is a plane slop cut into a series of flat surfaces for effective farming. Platforms are known as terraces. The amazing thing about this farming is water never stop if the upper one is full, automatically it goes on the lower one. Moreover, it can be profitable farming in India. <br>In farmed areas, agricultural terracing is either level or tilted. They depend on the soil infiltration properties. Soil infiltration is enough for levelling.<br><br>•	<b>Broad-Base Terrace Farming:- </b><br>This farming method is suitable for the gentlest hills, and terrace farming includes all the slopes.<br> <br>
•	<b>Grassed Back-Slope Terrace Farming:-</b> <br>This type of farming is perennial terracing, as the back slope cover is perennial grass.<br> <br>
•	<b>Narrow-Base Terrace Farming:-</b><br>Another example of perennial terracing, but permanent crops cover both the back and front sides in this farming.<br><br><br><br><br>

Multiple cropping refers to growing more than one crop in the same field during the season. In agriculture, multiple cropping or multi-cropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in the same piece of land during one growing season instead of just one crop. This technique makes effective use of inputs such as soil, water, fertilizer, etc. When multiple crops are grown simultaneously, this is also known as intercropping. Thus output per unit area increases with manifold returns to the growers. An important aspect of multiple cropping is the utilization of nutrients more efficiently as the crops growing on the same piece of land simultaneously would have different nutritional requirements.<br><br><br><br><br>
